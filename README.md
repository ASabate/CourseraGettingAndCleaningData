Date: 22/11/2015

This is the Getting And Cleaning Data Coursera Course Project. <br/>
The repository includes:
- README.md: current README file.<br/>
- run_analysis.R: R project code.<br/>
- tidy.txt: output result.<br/>
- Codebook.md: Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.<br/>

<br/>
The run_analysis.R script does:<br/>
1. Load the activity and feature info <br/>
2. Load the training and test data, extracting only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation<br/>
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set<br/>
4. Output result into a text file named tidy.txt<br/>
